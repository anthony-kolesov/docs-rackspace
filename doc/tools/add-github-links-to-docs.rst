Add GitHub links for contributors
---------------------------------

Add GitHub links to the documentation navigation menu to make it easy for
readers to propose changes or submit feedback directly to the GitHub repository
where you manage the project.

.. note::
     These instructions apply to Sphinx documentation projects that are
     deployed by the Nexus publishing platform.


You can add either of the following GitHub links:

- An **Edit on GitHub** link opens an editable copy of the source file for the
  current topic so that people can update the source and submit
  a GitHub pull request for review.

  Add support for *Edit on GitHub* link if your documentation is in a public
  repository and you want active, direct contributions. This type of link works
  best for projects that use a topic-based content architecture where each
  major topic is displayed on its own page.

- The **Submit an Issue** link opens a GitHub issue page so that people can
  report a bug or provide feedback about the documentation.

  Add support for *Submit an issue* links if your project is in a private
  repository, or if you prefer people to report issues or problems rather than
  updating content directly.  This link type works best for projects that
  display a large collection of topics in a single view. In these projects,
  the *Edit on GitHub* link is less useful because it opens the source file
  for the first topic, which can make it difficult for contributors to find
  the content they want to change.


Configuring GitHub links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 You configure GitHub links for a documentation project by updating the
 ``_deconst.json`` file in the same directory as your documentation project
 configuration file as shown in the following examples.

**Example: Configuring an "Edit on GitHub link"**

.. code::

      {
        "contentIDBase": "https://github.com/rackerlabs/$reponame/$version/",
        "githubUrl": "https://github.com/rackerlabs/$reponame/",
        "githubBranch": "master",
        "meta": {
        "preferGithubIssues": false
       }
      }

The *$reponame* and *$version* variables represent the values for each project.
Not all projects have a version in the path.


**Example: Configuring a "Submit an issue" link**

.. code::

      {
        "contentIDBase": "https://github.com/rackerlabs/$reponame/$version",
        "githubUrl": "https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/",
        "githubBranch": "master",
        "meta": {
        "preferGithubIssues": true
        }
      }


**Configuration parameters**

``contentIDBase``
      A unique ID that identifies the content repository to the Nexus
      publishing platform. The value specified must match the one specified
      in the `deconst control repository configuration file
      <https://github.com/rackerlabs/nexus-control/tree/master/config/content.d>`_
      for the site where content is deployed. This value is required to build
      and deploy the content.

``githubUrl``
     The base URL for constructing the GitHub links to display in the
     navigation menu. For *Edit on GitHub* links, specify the URL for the
     documentation source repository. For *Submit an issue* links, decide
     whether you want issues to be created in the documentation project
     repository or in a different respository. Then, specify the URL for the
     target repository.

     .. note::
          If your repository is private, specify the URL for
          another repository. Otherwise, the link target
          returns a 404 for users that cannot access the private repository.


``githubBranch``
     The target branch that determines the branch for submitting changes.
     If this value is not specified, it defaults to master. To override the
     default, set this parameter to the branch name.

``preferGithubIssues``
     Indicates the GitHub link type. Set this value to true
     to include the *Submit an issue* link. Set it to false to include an
     *Edit on GitHub* link."


   .. note::

      <https://deconst.horse/writing-docs/author/>`_ in the Deconst
      documentation.
