=================================
Build Sphinx doc projects locally
=================================

These instructions are for local builds using the default Sphinx templates.
If you want to build locally using the Rackspace documentation templates, use
the `Deconst client <https://github.com/deconst/client>`_.

You might want to build locally to find and fix build errors before committing
your updates to the GitHub source repository. You also might want to review
format and navigational structure locally before you commit updates.
