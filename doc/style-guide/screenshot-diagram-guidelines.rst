   These guidelines conform to all of the rules outlined in the rest of the
   style guide.

Screenshot guidelines and process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your content references a user interface (UI), consider whether you
need to include screenshots. Screenshots can be helpful when text alone
cannot adequately convey instructions, and users like screenshots and
find them useful. However, screenshots are difficult and time-consuming
to maintain and present translation problems. Therefore, the use of
screenshots within your article should be kept to a minimum.

-  `Screenshots in procedures <#screenshots-in-procedures>`__
-  `Screenshot checklist <#screenshot-checklist>`__

Screenshot alternatives
-----------------------

As an alternative to screenshots, use the correct names of the UI labels
with which the user must interact and the values that they must choose
or enter. Show the names of buttons, options, check boxes, menus,
windows, dialog boxes, and so on as they appear on the UI. For example,
for straightforward instructions like, "To open a file, select **File >
Open**," a screenshot is not required.

When to use screenshots
-----------------------

You can use screenshots for the following purposes:

-  Orient users in a complicated or long procedure

-  Show complex windows or dialog boxes, such as those that contain
   multiple subsets of information, with free-form text fields and many
   options available for selection

When not to use screenshots
---------------------------

Do not include screenshot of the following items:

-  Code samples (instead, show code samples in code blocks)

-  Dialog boxes that are easy to understand, such as drop-down lists and
   option buttons with few or no free-form text fields

-  Confirmation boxes

-  License agreement boxes

-  Message text (instead show message text within regular text)

-  Progress bars

-  Welcome windows

-  Wizard pages, especially Welcome pages and other simple pages

-  Tables created in another authoring tool

Before you create a screenshot
------------------------------

Install Jing to capture and edit screenshots. `Jing is available as a
free download <https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html>`__.

To learn how to take a screenshot and make a callout, use the Jing
`capture an
image <https://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-jing-capture-an-image.html>`__
tutorial.

.. note::

   Jing does not support Linux distributions, but you can use
   other programs such as gscreendemp, GreenShot, and Shutter on Linux.

Screenshots in procedures
-------------------------

If you include a screenshot in a procedure, place it directly under the
step that it illustrates. Do not rely on the screenshot to show
information or values that the user must enter; always provide that
information in the text of the steps. However, ensure that the
screenshot accurately reflects the directions and values in the step
text.

Screenshot checklist
--------------------

Use the following standards when creating your screenshots:

-  **Size**: Make screenshots no larger than 600 pixels wide.
-  **Callouts**: Use only arrows and boxes for callouts.
-  **Scope**: Limit the scope of a screenshot to just the portion of
   the UI that shows the action, plus enough surrounding detail to help
   the user locate the item.
-  **Callout color**: Use **Red** (hexadecimal color **FF0000**) for
   all callouts.
-  **File name**: Create unique and meaningful file names to easily
   differentiate between screenshots.
-  **Titles:** Titles are not required, especially for screenshots
   in procedures and tutorials. If you want to add a title to a
   screenshot for clarity, follow the guidelines in :ref:`titles-and-headings`.

Diagram guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Diagrams can be useful tools to help users visualize complex processes
in a simplified fashion. However, diagrams can sometimes be too
simplistic, confusing the user instead of providing help. The decision
about whether a diagram might be helpful depends on the context of each
document and the discretion of each writer.

-  `Before you create a diagram <#before-you-create-a-diagram>`__
-  `Diagram checklist <#diagram-checklist>`__

When to use diagrams
--------------------

Include diagrams in the following situations:

-  When there is evidence of a process, whether the process is automated
   or manual

-  When you need to clarify configurations and settings, such as the
   architecture for virtual servers

-  When you need to define a complex workflow within a Rackspace product

When not to use diagrams
------------------------

Do not include diagrams in the following situations:

-  When a workflow is too simplistic, such as using the control panel to
   create a cloud server

-  When there is no interaction with a Rackspace product

Before you create a diagram
---------------------------

To create diagrams, you need to access the recommended software and
download the required icons and stencils.

Software
^^^^^^^^

Use `draw.io <https://www.draw.io/>`__ to create your diagrams. Draw.io
enables you to create diagrams directly in your web browser of choice.

To get started with draw.io, see the instructions in the `Draw.io Online
User
Manual <https://support.draw.io/display/DO/Draw.io+Online+User+Manual>`__.

Icons, stencils, and shapes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download Rackspace's library of product icons and stencils. These icons
and stencils are considered **objects**.

-  The product icons are blue and are located in `this zip
   file <https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/doc/style-guide/images/zip/ProductIcons.zip>`__.

-  Stencils are used to represent certain functions and hardware such as
   the world wide web or a server. These stencils are black and are
   located in `this zip
   file <https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/doc/style-guide/images/zip/RackspaceDiagramIcons.zip>`__.

After you download the icons and stencils, you can being making diagrams
in Draw.io.

Diagram checklist
-----------------

Use the following standards when creating diagrams:

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

Each diagram property is located on the right side of the Draw.io
main screen under **Diagrams**.

-  **Paper size**: Set the paper size to **A4 (210 mm x 297 mm)**
   and **Landscape**.

-  **Background color**: Set the background color to **none**.

-  **File format**: Save all diagrams as editable SVG files, as follows:

   #. Click **File > Save As**.
   #. Type a descriptive name for the file, and replace ``.xml`` with
      ``.svg`` at the end of the file name. The file is saved to your local
      directory.

-  **File name**: Create unique and meaningful file names to
   differentiate diagrams.

Text formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Font**: Set the font to **Helvetica**.

-  **Titles:** Title must be **bolded**, aligned **left**, and be at
   least **24px** in size.

Objects
^^^^^^^

-  **Product icons**: An icon represents it's corresponding product.
   Product icons are always blue.

      Cloud Images stencil

   .. note::

      If you find a Rackspace product icon that is not blue, send an email to
      how-to@rackspace.com and a member of our team will create a blue version
      of the icon.

-  **Stencils**: A stencil represents a concept or function.
   Stencils that are *not* Rackspace products should always appear in
   black.

-  **Labels**: Label all product icons, stencils, and shapes, must
   be labeled according to their function within the diagram.

Lines and arrows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Line usage**: Use lines are used to connect and display a
   relationship between two or more objects.

-  **Line width**: Line width must be at least **2pt**. You can
   change the width of a line in the **Format Panel** under **Style**
   when you select the line.

-  **Line shape**: Keep lines straight unless a line needs to change
   direction.

-  **Rounded line corners**: If a line changes direction, the corner
   in which the change of direction occurs must be rounded. You can
   change to rounded corners by selecting the line, going to the
   **Format Panel** under **Style**, and selecting **Rounded** in the
   dropdown menu.

-  **Solid lines**: Use solid lines to show a direct relationship
   between objects, as shown in the example below.

   .. figure:: images/img/solid-lines.png
      :alt: Example of solid lines

      Example of solid lines

-  **Dashed lines**: Use dashed lines to group objects that are
   connected through a network, as shown in the example below.

   .. figure:: images/img/dashed-lines.png
      :alt: Example of dashed lines

      Example of dashed lines

-  **Dotted lines**: Use dotted lines to show how data entered by
   the user travels, as shown in the example below.

   .. figure:: images/img/dotted-lines.png
      :alt: Example of dotted lines

      Example of dotted lines

-  **One-way and two-way arrows:** Use arrows to represent direct
   interactions between two or more stencils. If a stencil is attached
   to an arrow, it implies that the product represented by the stencil
   needs to interact with another piece of the diagram.

   In the following example, the CDN management service needs to interact
   with the CDN to perform its function. Similarly, the CDN needs to be
   managed by the CDN management service. The relationship is two-way, so
   the line has arrows on both ends pointed to both stencils.
