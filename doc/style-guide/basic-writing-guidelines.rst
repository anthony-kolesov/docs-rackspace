Write short, concise sentences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers can understand wordy and complex writing, but they shouldn't
be forced to read it. Use the following guidelines to improve focus and
clarity in your content by using short sentences.

-  `Use a consistent sentence
   structure <#use-a-consistent-sentence-structure>`__
-  `Restrict sentence length <#restrict-sentence-length>`__
-  `Omit unnecessary clauses, phrases, and
   words <#omit-unnecessary-clauses-phrases-and-words>`__
-  `Put serial items into bullet
   lists <#put-serial-items-into-bullet-lists>`__

Use a consistent sentence structure
-----------------------------------

As often as possible, use the sentence structure
*subject*—*verb*—*object*. Use simple declarative sentences for
descriptions, and use simple imperative sentences for instructions.
However, you can use a sentence structure that starts with an *if*
clause or places the condition before the action.

     - You can configure your settings in the directory if you must monitor
       clients from the host.

Restrict sentence length
------------------------

Even when a long sentence is well written, it can be harder to follow
and understand than a comparatively shorter sentence. For procedural
(task-oriented) information, try to limit sentences to 20 words. For
conceptual information, try to limit sentences to 25 words. If you must
write a longer sentence, it should have more than one clause and the
relationship between the clauses should be clear.

     - Click the check boxes to confirm whether you would like to Overwrite
       files with the same name or restore the files to their original folders
       and then click the **Next** button.

Omit unnecessary clauses, phrases, and words
--------------------------------------------

Ask yourself whether customers need to be told everything you are
telling them. Is anything so obvious that it does not need to be said?
Are you using adverbs (modifiers ending in *-ly*)? If so, most of them
can be removed without harming the meaning. Examine your use of
adjectives. If they are not needed, remove them. Can prepositional
phrases be shortened? Are you using empty phrases that do not clarify
the content?

       business-critical processes and workflows, you need reliable SharePoint
       hosting, backed by solid SharePoint expertise, to keep your environment
       performing optimally.

       enterprise-wide perspective.

.. note::

   Although shorter is usually better, do not omit necessary
   articles, prepositions, and connectors. Never sacrifice clarity for
   brevity.

Put serial items into bullet lists
----------------------------------

If a sentence contains a series of items, converting the items to a
bullet list often makes the sentence easier to read and easier to scan.

         you use to edit objects.
     - The product includes the Development perspective, which contains views
       and editors that you use to find, create, and update objects on servers,
       and the Editorial perspective, which contains just the editors and views
       you need when you are editing an object.
   * - From the Job Scheduler window, you can perform the following actions:


       - Run a generated script immediately.

       - Track the execution of submitted jobs.

       - Manage jobs in the job queue.
     - From the Job Scheduler page, you can run a generated script immediately,
       schedule a generated script to run at a later time, track the execution
       of submitted jobs, and manage jobs in the job queue.

Use active voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, write in *active* voice rather than *passive* voice.

-  Active voice identifies the agent of action as the subject of the
   verb—usually the user.
-  Passive voice identifies the recipient (not the source) of the action
   as the subject of the verb.

Active-voice sentences clarify the performer of an action and are easier
to understand than passive-voice sentences. Passive voice is usually
less engaging and more complicated than active voice. When you use
passive voice, the actions and responses of the software can be
difficult to distinguish from those of the user. In addition, passive
voice usually requires more words than active voice.

.. list-table::

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - After you install the software, start the computer.
     - After the software has been installed, the computer can be started.
   * - Click **OK** to save the configuration.
     - The configuration is saved when the **OK** button is clicked.
   * - Create a server.
     - A server is created by you.
   * - Rackspace products and services solve your business problems.
     - Your business problems are solved by Rackspace products and services.

However, passive voice is acceptable in the following situations:

-  Using active voice sounds like you are blaming the customer. For
   example, you can use passive voice in an error message or
   troubleshooting content when the active subject is the customer.
-  The agent of action is unknown, or you want to de-emphasize the agent
   of action and emphasize the object on which the action is performed.
-  Recasting the sentence in active voice is wordy or awkward.

   * - Account owners cannot be assigned additional roles, and their access cannot be restricted.
     - Administrators cannot assign account owners additional roles, and they cannot restrict the access of account owners.
     - In this context, the object, account owners, is more important than the actor, administrators.

Use present tense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For
them, these activities take place in their present, so the present tense
is appropriate in most cases. Additionally, present tense is easier to
read than past or future tense.

Use future tense only when you need to emphasize that something will
occur later (from the customers' perspective). To easily find and remove
instances of future tense, search for *will*.

     - To back up Cloud Sites to Cloud Files by using this example, you **will

       Cloud Files.

       ServiceNet database instances.
   * - When the contract changes, Rackspace **will notify** customers in
       release notes.
     - Not applicable. Future tense is appropriate in this example.

.. _write-to-the-user:

Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers are more engaged with documentation when you use second person
(that is, you address the customer as *you*). Second person promotes a
friendly tone by addressing customers directly. Using second person with
the imperative mood (in which the subject *you* is understood) and
active voice helps to eliminate wordiness and confusion about who or
what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps.

Using second person also avoids the use of gender-specific, third-person
pronouns such as *he*, *she*, *his*, and *hers*. If you must use third
person, use the pronouns *they* and *their*, but ensure that the pronoun
matches the referenced noun in number.

Use first person plural pronouns (*we*, *our*) judiciously. These
pronouns emphasize the writer or Rackspace rather than the customer, so
before you use them, consider whether second person or imperative mood
is more "user friendly." However, use *we recommend* rather than *it is
recommended* or *Rackspace recommends*. Also, you can use *we* in the
place of *Rackspace* if necessary.

The first-person singular pronoun *I* is acceptable in the question part
of FAQs and when authors of blogs or signed articles are describing
their own actions or opinions.

Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document. Switching
person is acceptable, however, in blog posts that use first-person
singular but then switch to second person for instructional steps.

Create short paragraphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Short paragraphs are easier to scan and understand. Use the following
guidelines for paragraphs:

- Cover only one idea in each paragraph.
- Limit paragraphs to four to five sentences. However, avoid having
  one-sentence paragraphs.
- Use connective or transitional words to ensure flow within and between
  paragraphs.
- When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of embedding the
  items in a paragraph.

The following example shows how breaking up a long paragraph by using a
list makes it easy for the customer to scan the text.

       you select for deletion are highlighted with a dark gray background.
       When you delete a file, it is permanently removed from the Cloud Files
       container.

Use short, familiar words and phrases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use short, familiar words and phrases to convey an idea clearly. Such
words and phrases are more conversational, save space, are easier to
scan, and are often easier for non-native English speakers to
understand. Use a longer word or phrase only if necessary to convey a
special meaning.

If a word has variant spellings that are equally acceptable (such as
*canceled* and *cancelled*), use the shorter spelling.

       your questions about the service.
     - This guide is designed to get you up and running with the service and to
       answer any questions that you may have about the service.

Use consistent terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted
industry dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project. Each
word or phrase should have only one meaning, and should be used
consistently throughout the documentation.

-  Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts.
   For example, don't use *agent* to refer to both a person and a
   process.

-  If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't
   use it to express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the
   general meaning. For example, use *interface* as a noun that means
   user interface. Instead of also using *interface* as a verb, use
   *interact*.

-  Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the
   use of one word for a particular object. Technical writing is not
   creative writing, and you should not be concerned that you will bore
   customers with colorless prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a
   precise set of terms consistently is required. Following is a common
   example of multiple terms that refer to the same thing:

   -  menu command *(the preferred term)*
   -  menu item
   -  menu option

-  Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly
   used as a verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as *display*.
   However, using the same word as more than one part of speech in the
   same document can be confusing to customers and translators, so avoid
   it when possible.

-  Avoid fabricated words. Examples of fabricated words are
   *marketecture* or *edutainment*. Most such words are specific to a
   single business culture and are not understood in other cultures.

-  Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.

-  Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms
   have similar but distinct meanings and should not be used
   interchangeably. For example:

   -  environment, platform
   -  version, release
   -  panel, screen
   -  window, dialog box

For guidelines about specific words, see :ref:`alphabetical-list-of-terms`.

Use simple action verbs, and don't turn them into nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your documentation
come alive for customers. To make the biggest impact with your writing,
use strong, simple, action verbs, and use the guidelines in this
section.

-  `Use action-oriented verbs instead of weak
   verbs <#use-action-oriented-verbs-instead-of-weak-verbs>`__
-  `Turn noun+verb constructions into verb-only
   constructions <#turn-noun-verb-constructions-into-verb-only-constructions>`__
-  `Use the simplest tense <#use-the-simplest-tense>`__
-  `Use helping verbs accurately <#use-helping-verbs-accurately>`__
-  `Use single-word verbs <#use-single-word-verbs>`__
-  `Do not use verbs as nouns or
   adjectives <#do-not-use-verbs-as-nouns-or-adjectives>`__
-  `Do not use nonverbs as verbs <#do-not-use-nonverbs-as-verbs>`__
-  `Use transitive verbs transitively, not
   intransitively <#use-transitive-verbs-transitively-not-intransitively>`__
-  `Avoid using anthropomorphic verbs to describe inanimate
   objects <#avoid-using-anthropomorphic-verbs-to-describe-inanimate-objects>`__

Use action-oriented verbs instead of weak verbs
-----------------------------------------------

When you use weak verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their
variants), or when you use gerunds (*ing* words), nouns instead of
verbs carry the main action of the sentence. Shift the focus from nouns
to verbs by replacing weak verbs and gerunds with strong,
action-oriented verbs. Relying on verbs rather than nouns usually makes
sentence shorter, clearer, and more direct.

Turn noun+verb constructions into verb-only constructions
---------------------------------------------------------

Many nouns that we commonly use are built from verbs. When a verb is
transformed into a noun, the resulting noun is called a
*nominalization*. Sentences that include a nominalization and a verb can
often be simplified by changing the nominalization back into a verb and
omitting the existing verb (as shown in the following examples).
Excessive and unnecessary use of nominalizations contributes to
wordiness and dilutes meaning. Omit them when possible.

     - The program **enables the encryption of** user IDs and passwords.

Use the simplest tense
----------------------

Simple verbs, such as verbs in the present tense, are easier to read and
understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or
perfect tense, or verbs combined with helping verbs (such as *can*,
*may*, *might*, *must*, and *should*).

.. _helping-verbs:

Use helping verbs accurately
----------------------------

If you need to use the following helping verbs, use them accurately and
consistently:

- **Can**: Use *can* to indicate the ability to perform an action.
- **May**: Use *may* to indicate permission.
- **Might**: Use *might* to indicate probability or possibility.
- **Must**: You can use *must* to indicate the necessity of an action.
  However, in general, use the imperative mood, which implies the subject you
  and does not require *must*, yet still indicates necessity.
- **Should**: Use *should* to tell customers what they *ought* to do. Because
  *should* implies uncertainty, avoid using it unless you explain further.

   * - The worker **must** delete the message when work is done.
   * - To avoid losing a claim in the middle of processing a message, clients
       **should** periodically renew claims during long-running batches of
       work.

Use single-word verbs
---------------------

When possible, use single-word verbs rather than phrasal verbs (verbs
followed by prepositions or adverbs). For example, use *omit* rather
than *leave out*, or shorten *start up* to *start*. One-word verbs are
easier to understand and to translate.

If you must use a phrasal verb, keep the parts of the verb together
unless that changes the meaning of the sentence. Some acceptable phrasal
verbs are *back up*, *log in*, *set up*, *shut down*, and *work around*.

.. note::

   Do not turn a phrasal verb into a single-word verb. For
   example, do not use *login*, *setup*, or *workaround* as verbs. These
   single-word terms should be used only as nouns or adjectives.

Do not use verbs as nouns or adjectives

noun or adjective. Some verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or
adjectives are *configure*, *compile*, *debug*, and *install*.

Use transitive verbs transitively, not intransitively
-----------------------------------------------------

Transitive verbs, such as *load*, *display*, *complete*, and *execute*,
require a direct object. Intransitive verbs do not require a direct
object. Be sure to use each type of verb correctly.

To avoid using a transitive verb intransitively, you can make it passive

Avoid using anthropomorphic verbs to describe inanimate objects
---------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful not to ascribe human feelings, motivations, and actions to
inanimate objects. For example, a software program does not know, need,
remember, see, think, understand, or want. However, it can detect,
record, require, store, check, calculate, and process.

The following anthropomorphic verbs are acceptable in the computer
industry: accept, calculate, deny, detect, interact, interpret, listen,
refuse, read, and write.

Clarify gerunds and participles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participles are verbs that end in *-ed* or *-ing* and act as modifiers.
Gerunds are verbs that end in *-ing* and act as nouns. Both types of
words are useful and acceptable, but confusion can arise if they are not
placed precisely in a sentence. For example, the word *meeting* can be a
gerund or a modifier (or even a noun) depending on its placement in a
sentence. Clarify gerunds and participles as necessary.

The last example illustrates a dangling modifier. In the "Avoid"
example, *using* does not have a subject, so the implied subject is
*address*, which is incorrect. If the implied subject is not correct,
you must revise the sentence to provide a subject for the modifying
phrase.

Gerunds are used to start headings for process topics. Ensure that their
meaning is not ambiguous.

.. _use-interjections-with-care:

Use interjections with care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by
an exclamation point. For example, expressions such as *Hooray!*,
*Excuse me!*, *Sorry!*, *No thank you!*, *Oh dear!*, and *Hey, that's
mine!* are interjections.

In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate. For example, at the
end of a procedure that targets *novice* customers, you might write,
"Congratulations! You successfully created your first cloud server."

However, because the tone of an interjection can be condescending, use
them sparingly and with care.

.. _restrictive-clauses:

Use restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A restrictive clause is essential to the meaning of a sentence because
it limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause,
you change the essential meaning of the sentence. You indicate a
restrictive clause with the relative pronoun *that* or *who*, and you do
not set off a restrictive clause with commas.

A nonrestrictive clause does not change the core meaning of the
sentence. You set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and the
relative pronouns *which* or *who*.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Restrictive clause
     - Nonrestrictive clause
   * - He hired the man **who came from Kansas**. (Not the man from Idaho)
     - Jackhammers, **which are useful for breaking up concrete**, are on sale.
   * - Enter the user name and password **that you just created**. (Not the
       user name and password that you created last month)
     - The hourly backups are rolled into a nightly backup, **which is retained
       for two days**.

Be sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

-  Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify
   restrictive clauses in which that is missing by looking for two
   successive nouns.
-  Do not substitute *which* for *that*.

.. list-table::

       goal.

       A task presents **information which a customer needs** to achieve a
       specific goal.

Clarify pronouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pronouns are useful, but you must ensure that their antecedents (the
words that they are used in place of) are clear, and that they (the
pronouns) don’t contribute to vagueness and ambiguity. The following
pronouns often cause problems, so use them carefully: *it*, *this*,
*there*, and *that*.

It
--

Ensure that the antecedent of *it* is clear. If multiple singular nouns
precede *it*, any of them could be the antecedent.

Avoid using *it is* to begin a sentence. Such a construction hides the
real subject of the sentence.

.. list-table::

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - You can store the value and use it again later.
     - The product stores the value in the configuration file. You can use it

       the file.)
   * - You must close all open windows before you run the script.
     - It is important that you close all open windows before you run the
       script.

This
----

Avoid beginning a sentence with the pronoun *this*, unless you follow
*this* with a noun to clarify its meaning.

   * - This option causes an error when you run the program.
     - This causes an error when you run the program.

There
-----

Avoid using *there is* and *there are* as the subject of a sentence or
clause. Using *there* shifts the focus away from the real subject and
often uses unnecessary words.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

     - The Cloud Sites FTP service supports resumable uploading. This means
       that if there is a connection failure during an upload, it does not have
       to be started from the beginning.

That
----

Although you should use *that* as a relative pronoun (see `Use
restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses
correctly <#use-restrictive-and-nonrestrictive-clauses-correctly>`__),
avoid using it as a demonstrative pronoun (which stands in for or points
to a noun). Instead, use it as an adjective and follow it with a noun.

Include all necessary words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include all the words that are necessary to make the meaning of a
sentence clear the first time it is read. Include all necessary articles
(*a*, *an*, *the*) and other syntactic cues, such as those described in
`Clarify gerunds and participles <#clarify-gerunds-and-participles>`__,
`Use restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses

       Ubuntu **later** than 12.04.

Use correct punctuation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When customers have to reread a sentence or paragraph to understand it,
faulty punctuation is often the culprit. Following are some common
situations:

- A comma is omitted.
- An unnecessary comma is used.
- A long sentence contains overly complex punctuation.
- A parenthetical phrase occurs in the middle of an instruction.

All of these situations can inhibit comprehension. By using correct
punctuation in general, keeping sentences short, and using consistent
punctuation in lists, procedures, and tables, you help customers to
understand what you mean *the first time* they read the text. Following
are a few basic guidelines to apply:

-  Use a comma before the last item in a series (known as the *serial*
   comma).
-  Use a comma to separate independent clauses, and be sure to include a
   coordinating conjunction.
-  Avoid using semicolons to separate clauses. They can make long
   sentences seem even longer. You can almost always use a period in the
   place of a semicolon.
-  Do not use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series
   of, actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash
   mark. Exceptions are established terms like *client/server* and
   *read/write*.

For additional specific punctuation guidelines and examples, see
:ref:`Punctuation <punctuation-guidelines>`. For basic
rules about punctuation, see a grammar book, such as the *Harbrace
College Handbook*.

.. note::

   Avoid using exclamation points, question marks, ellipses (three dots), or
   single quotation marks in text. Although these punctuation marks might
   appear in code elements, messages, literal commands, or UIs, they are rarely
   useful when writing descriptions or instructions for customers. One
   exception is the use of question marks in FAQ topics.

.. _avoid-obscure-words:

Avoid obscure non-English words and abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some non-English words and abbreviations are difficult to translate, and
some customers might be unfamiliar with them. Some Latin abbreviations,
like *i.e.*, *e.g.*, and *etc.*, are unnecessarily vague. The following
table lists terms and abbreviations to avoid, and their preferred
alternatives.

Write for a global audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace is a global company, with customers in many countries. A small
amount of content has been translated, but most has not, which means
that many customers who do not speak English as their first language
consume our English content. All of the guidelines in this topic ("Basic
writing guidelines") are designed to make content easy to understand for
all audiences, but the following guidelines will especially clarify
content for global audiences.

-  `Do not use idioms or
   colloquialisms <#do-not-use-idioms-or-colloquialisms>`__
-  `Avoid metaphorical terms <#avoid-metaphorical-terms>`__
-  `Do not use humor <#do-not-use-humor>`__
-  `Use jargon carefully <#use-jargon-carefully>`__
-  `Use culture-neutral language and
   examples <#use-culture-neutral-language-and-examples>`__
-  `Use culture-neutral graphics <#use-culture-neutral-graphics>`__
-  `Avoid abbreviated date formats <#avoid-abbreviated-date-formats>`__

Do not use idioms or colloquialisms
-----------------------------------

An *idiom* is an expression whose meaning cannot be derived from the
literal meaning of the individual words. Some examples are *in a
nutshell*, *the bottom line*, *across the board*, and *on the fly*.

A *colloquialism* is an expression considered more appropriate to
familiar and casual conversation than to formal speech or to formal
writing. Although we might like to establish a more conversational tone
in some content, colloquialisms can be hard for non-native English
speakers to understand, and they are hard to translate.

Avoid idioms and colloquialisms as often as possible.

The following table lists some idioms and colloquialisms, and provides
alternatives that you can use. Note that the alternative terms are
generally shorter than their idiomatic or colloquial counterparts.

.. list-table::

   * - what's more
     - moreover
   * - a hair smaller than
     - slightly smaller than
   * - when you are done
     - when you are finished

Avoid metaphorical terms
------------------------

A *metaphor* is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase that
denotes one kind of object or action is used in place of another to
suggest a likeness or analogy between them. Although some common
metaphors are easy even for people who do not speak English as a first
language, avoid them as often as possible.

The following table provides some examples of metaphorical terms that
can easily be replaced with one or more words.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Metaphor
     - Alternative
   * - a handful of companies
     - a few companies

     - postpone a discussion
   * - the vanilla model
     - the standard model
   * - avoid common pitfalls
     - avoid common problems
   * - the drawback of frequent updates
     - the disadvantage of frequent updates

Do not use humor
----------------

Humor is culture specific. What might be funny in one culture might be
offensive or obscene in another culture. Humor doesn't translate well,
literally or figuratively, so don't use it.

Use jargon carefully
--------------------

*Jargon* is the specialized language of a profession. Jargon can be
useful for technical audiences, but it can be meaningless to novice
customers and difficult to translate. Do not use jargon if you can
easily and correctly use a more common or familiar term, or if the
jargon obfuscates rather than clarifies the meaning. However, if the
jargon is essential to the technical meaning of the content, use it. If
the audience is not highly technical, consider explaining any jargon
that you use.

The following table lists some jargon typically used in the high tech
industry and some possible alternatives.

**Use with Caution:** This list is under construction as we determine
what jargon is acceptable. If one of these terms is used in content that
is provided by support or development, determine whether it is
appropriate for the audience.

Use culture-neutral language and examples
-----------------------------------------

Cultural references and examples in your documentation can cause
problems for a global audience and for translation. Sounds, colors,
animals, gestures, events, and symbols do not convey the same meaning in
every culture.

-  Do not use the names of places, public figures, or holidays. If you
   must, use examples that represent a variety of cultures or that are
   internationally recognized. For example, use international cities,
   such as Paris, New York, Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong.

-  Do not use political, religious, ethnic, or historical references.

-  Do not use metaphors that are specific to one culture (for example,
   an American football metaphor).

Use generic examples that work in any target market.

If you create "named" users for extended examples or scenarios, use
names that represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds, genders, and
locations.

Use culture-neutral graphics
----------------------------

Use graphics whenever possible to present processes and complex ideas.
However, be aware of the following possible issues:

-  Some customers do not typically read from left to right. If a
   graphics illustrates a sequence, make that sequence explicit by using
   numbers, arrows, or directional terms.

-  Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning. The color red, for
   example, has different meanings in different countries so could be
   interpreted differently by different customers. Also, colors can have
   political or religious significance. Use neutral colors as often as
   possible.

-  Do not use a picture of a hand by itself (for example, a hand that is
   pointing). Almost every hand gesture is offensive to someone. A
   picture of a hand that is holding an item or interacting with
   something is generally acceptable.

-  Use generic or international images. Some examples are soccer players
   and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, and generic
   images of computer equipment. Avoid using images of men, women,
   flags, maps, animals, alcohol, trendy objects, historical references,
   or film, cartoon, or video characters.

Avoid abbreviated date formats
------------------------------

Date formats vary among cultures. Write out dates, unless you are
showing a literal representation as it is displayed in the software or
you need to use an abbreviation in a table or figure. If you use
abbreviations, include an explanation and use the abbreviated format
consistently.
